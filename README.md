## Running The Application Locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `com.business.customermanagement.CustomerManagementApplication` class from your IDE.

* 	Download the zip or clone the Git repository.
* 	Unzip the zip file (if you downloaded one)
* 	Open Command Prompt and Change directory (cd) to folder containing pom.xml
* 	Open Eclipse
	* File -> Import -> Existing Maven Project -> Navigate to the folder where you unzipped the zip
	* Select the project
* 	Choose the Spring Boot Application file (search for @SpringBootApplication)
* 	Right Click on the file and Run as Java Application

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

mvn spring-boot:run
```

Note: Please make sure you have JDK 11 installed on your system as default runtime environment is set to Java 11. 
If you have any other version installed(should be higher than JDK 1.8), please make sure you change `java.version` property in pom.xml.
